# Stormpath is Joining Okta

We are incredibly excited to announce that [Stormpath is joining forces with Okta](https://stormpath.com/blog/stormpaths-new-path?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm-campaign=okta-announcement). Please visit [the Migration FAQs](https://stormpath.com/oktaplusstormpath?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm-campaign=okta-announcement) for a detailed look at what this means for Stormpath users.

We're available to answer all questions at [support@stormpath.com](mailto:support@stormpath.com).

## What does this mean for developers who are using this library?

Please refer to this issue for up-to-date information about our progress with the
migration:

## README

If you are actively using this library, you can find the readme in [OLD-README.md](OLD-README.md).
It is not possible to register for new Stormpath tenants at this time, so you must
already have a Stormpath tenant if you wish to use this library during the migration
period.
